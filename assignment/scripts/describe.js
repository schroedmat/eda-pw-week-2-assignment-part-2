// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we made a variable called name and set it to 'Dane'
// we checked if the variable name was stricly equal to 'Mary', which it isn't
// we console.log 'How do you do?'
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we made a variable called secret
// we made a variable called code and set it to '123'
// we check if code is strictly equal to '123' which it is, so the variable secret is assigned to 'super' and variable code is assigned code multiplied by 2.
// we check if variable code is greater than 250, which is currently at a value of 246 so it is not great than 250. we console.log 'super'

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we create 3 variables and assign values; isStudent is a boolean with true, age is assigned 34, and zip is assigned 55407
// we check if isStudent is strictly equal to true and if zip is greater than 80000. The zip > 80000 condition isn't met so it goes to the next condition
// we check if isStudent is strictly equal to false or if age is less than 30. Neither of these conditions are met so it goes to the next condition
// we check if isStudent is strictly equal to true, which it is.  we console.log 'Welcome to Prime!

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

// colorOne is set to red and colorTwo is set to blue. 
// should be let colorOne = 'blue' 
// should be let colorTwo = 'red'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

//The description calls for the and condition but an or condition is currently coded.  
//Sholuld be if (temp > 39 && time >=4)

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;

// the description says it starts with two variables but minAge is a constant
// shoulld be let minAge = 21;

const minAge = 21;

// the description says we check if age is greater than or equal to minAge but this is showing less than or equal to
// should be if(minAge >= age) {
  
if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
